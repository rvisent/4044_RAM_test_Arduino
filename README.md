# 4044_RAM_test_Arduino
a quick&amp;dirty SRAM tester, made to find defective RAMs in an Heathkit H8

Circuit and Arduino Nano sketch made to test TMS4044 RAMs in an old (1978) Heathkit H8 computer not functioning. The RAMs were mounted in two 8 kbyte expansion boards (16 RAM chips each).
5 RAM ICs found defective on one board. Second board to be tested soon...
